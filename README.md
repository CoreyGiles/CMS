# CMS

CMS (covariates for multi-phenotype studies) is an approach that improves univariate association test power when a large number of correlated variables have been measured on the same samples. It consists in selecting, for a given outcome-predictor pair, a set of available variables to be included in the model as covariate.

Some basic guidelines for using the script are provided in the wiki [here](https://github.com/haschard/CMS/wiki).
